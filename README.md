# EcomTechTest

E-Commerce Endpoint Task

Basic API endpoint for creating a cart, user and order (currently won't work as i didn't have time to finish)
Will write everything to a sql database 

Uses Automapper for ORM
Most things Abstracted away for testing purposes (currently not tests as i was told they wouldn't be read)

Notes for improvement:
 - Should have used session data. 
 - All repo calls should be async and methods should be tasks. 
 - Attibutes on classes for validation. 
 - Mappings seperated out. 
 - Currently It won't accept json objects as input for the api calls. 
 - api keys/tokens. 
 - git branches should be seperated into develop and master 
 - make more use of the logger, using serilog or something similar
